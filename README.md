# Shopper

Haven't had time to test the do-while loop with user input but you should get the idea.

Displays a catalogue and allows users to select items they want to purchase along with a quantity.

Has functions to add, remove, display cart, display total price, clear cart, display catalogue and exit program.

Yes I uploaded the files intead of going through gitbash but I was in a rush, please don't crucify me.


POTENTIAL ERRORS:
Currently displaying that exit condition is always false, but shouldn't be the case.
